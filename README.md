# FlexEDMS

An [Igor Pro](https://www.wavemetrics.com/) package for organizing and analyzing flexible electronic materials and device data.

### Current Features

The current version allows users to import, organize, and analyze data from several types of device measurements:
- OPV J-V curves (dark, light, intensity dependence)
- OPV impedance-photocurrent device analysis (IPDA)
- diode time-of-flight charge transport

### References

For more information about the impedance-photocurrent device analysis (IPDA) technique, see

Sci. 11, 3019 (2018).](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326606809_Measuring_the_Competition_between_Bimolecular_Charge_Recombination_and_Charge_Transport_in_Organic_Solar_Cells_under_Operating_Conditions)

### Installation Instructions:

If you place the FlexEDMS folder into the Igor Procedures folder, the FlexEDMS submenu will appear in the toolbar when you start Igor Pro.
